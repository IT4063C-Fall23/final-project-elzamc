# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# Mental health. It is a topic that, while accepted moreso now, has aspects that are still underlooked. While some people can easily reach out and recognize their own poor mental health, others are too anxious or don't even attempt to reach out. This is very impactful for me personally along with many others I have met.

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# How prominent is poor mental health?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# Very common would be the easiest and shortest answer. 

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# 
# 
# These datasets will help answer the question of the prominence of mental health.

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# üìù <!-- Start Discussing the project here; you can add as many code cells as you need -->
# 
# My approach is simple. The Kaggle datasets provide huge insights on a global and smaller scale. This includes a bunch of different angles too, like in tech, a more global scale, and social media.

# ## Resources and References
# *What resources and references have you used for this project?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# Kaggle only.

# Charts:
# 
# Percentage of Respondents Who Received Treatment by Age (In Tech):
# Interesting to see the variety in when people get treatment. Should they get it sooner? 
# 
# Percentage of Individuals Taking Prescription Medication for Mental Health by Gender:
# This can be intepreted a lot of different ways, but theoretically, this should be 50/50 and not so onesided. This is very important to look at!
# 
# Percentage of Individuals Taking Prescription Medication for Mental Health by State:
# I think its interesting to analyze this statewide and how different it is state to state. This makes me ask a lot of whys. Why is Hawaii the least amount? Why is West Virginia the most? 
# 
# Presence of Depression among Students:
# This was made to show how common depression is. While it may seem like a "low" statistic, that is 1/3 people from what I gathered here.
# 
# Presence of Panic Attacks among Students:
# Done for a similar reason as above. This shows how panic attacks probably tie into depression, and again, close to 1/3.
